# riscv-vector
The repo is built for Vector Acceleration IP core for RISC-V*.  
## Introduction
Vector Acceleration IP core for RISC-V* is to design a flexible RISC-V Vector unit, which targets at high-performance CPU and domain specific accelerator. Vector is widely used in AI, HPC, cloud etc. RISC-V Vector extension is more scalable and flexible. The vector unit leverage open vector interface to make it ease to integrate with many types of scalar core. The vector unit is designed with Chisel hardware design language.
