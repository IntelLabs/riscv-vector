# riscv-vector
Vector Acceleration IP core for RISC-V*.  
## Introduction
Vector Acceleration IP core for RISC-V* is a flexible RISC-V Vector unit that aims to support RISC-V Vector extension. The interface is based on OVI (Open Vector Interface) in order to integrate with different scalar cores. The code is written with Chisel. 
## Status
Under test 
## License
Only the OVI(Open Vector Interface) is under Solderpad Hardware License v2.1 and others follow the Mulan PSL v2.
